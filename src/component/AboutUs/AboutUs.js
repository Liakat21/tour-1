        <p class="card-text">Thomas editorial output across our full client list. He cut his teeth in the muddy world of 4x4s, then spent six years testing sensible cars at Which? (following MR founder Peter’s path some 30 years earlier). Today, he enjoys indulging in odd supercar and loves anything hot with a hatchback. He has a lengthy back-catalogue of Golf GTIs, while the coolest car he’s owned is an E30 BMW M3.</p>
